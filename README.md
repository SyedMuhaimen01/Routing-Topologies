# Routing-Topologies
Designed on Cisco Packet Tracer, this project includes routing algorithms including OSPF, EIGRP and RIP version 2. 
You are given the network design with minimal technical documentation; your task is to make this up and run in
Cisco Packet tracer.

1. Following are the steps you need to perform in the topology according to the given layout. Configure
this scenario and find your given IP address in the file "IP addresses" attached with this. Every one of you is
assigned with its unique IP address. Find out the Network Addresses and start working with them. And use
them as required.
2. Please find the number of required hosts per subnet in the same attached file. Each student is given a
different number of required hosts per subnet. Networks are labeled alphabetically in the given spreadsheet of IP
ADDRESSES.
3. Use appropriate routing methods as mentioned on the top of each block.
4. Use Redistribution on Routers that connect two different blocks with each other.
5. All hosts in EIGRP, OSPF areas 1, 2, and RIP will get IP addresses from the "DHCP Server" present in
the last block at the bottom.
6. You have to use VLSM in each network of the topology. Remember that between two routers you need a
total of 4 ip addresses. And information about host requirements of all other networks is provided in the
attached file as mentioned above.
7. You have to IMPLEMENT NAT in Router6 with the Network A. Use the Private IP Address given to
you in the attached file for Natting.
8. One of the PCs of Network A will not be allowed to access the web server. All hosts connected in
network D will not be allowed to access "Web Server".
9. There is a “mail server” in the first block. All the hosts in the first block will have email configured and
can send email to each other.
